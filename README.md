Data related to "A DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF TWITTER COMMUNICATION TO FOSTER FOREIGN DIPLOMACY"

In this study twitter data was extracted from below mentioned accounts to be referred as their respective points:
  * A: Sun Weindong, Chinese Ambassador to India,  `@China_Amb_India`
  * B: India in China, Embassy of India Beijing, `@EOIBeijing`
  
As, the current Indian Ambassador to China, Pradeep Kumar Rawat doesnâ€™t have twitter presence, we have considered the official embassy twitter handle as the replacement node for the study. We have extracted all tweets for the nodes between the period of May 17, 2022, to December 17, 2021. The total statistics on tweets collected is represented in below table:

| Node    | A     | B     |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| Tweets  | 278   | 200   |

This repository contains the tweets and the wordclouds generated from the data. The nomenclature standard is:
  * Collated Tweets: Node_Collated.csv ==> Example: `A_Collated.csv`
  * Month-wise Tweets for Nodes: Node_MMM_Year.csv ==> Example: `A_Mar_2022.csv`
  * Top 80 Keywods from Collated Tweets: Node_Collated.png ==> Example: `A_Collated.png`
  * Top 80 Keywords from Negative/Positive Tweets: Node_Sentiment_Collated.png ==> Example: `A_Positive_Collated.png`
